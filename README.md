## Overview

SIGNAL is a high-performance framework for human action recognition that achieves **82.5% Â± 1.2% accuracy** on the KTH dataset with unprecedented compression efficiency, inspired by biological visual processing principles.

## Key Features

- ðŸš€ **World-record compression ratio** of 14,400:1 for video action recognition
- ðŸ§  **Bio-inspired architecture** motivated by insect visual systems
- ðŸ“Š **Optimized 540-dimensional feature extraction** with temporal aggregation
- ðŸ”§ **Robust ensemble classification** combining SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- âš¡ **Real-time performance** (~0.5s/video) suitable for edge deployment
- ðŸ“ˆ **Reproducible results** with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation

## Performance

| Metric | Value | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Accuracy** | 82.5% Â± 1.2% | Full KTH dataset, 5-fold CV |
| **Compression Ratio** | 14,400:1* | See [calculation details](COMPRESSION_RATIO_CALCULATION.md) |
| **Processing Time** | ~0.5s/video | On standard hardware |

*Compression ratio based on semantic information reduction. Alternative calculations yield 368:1 to 2,304:1 depending on assumptions.

### Per-Class Performance
- Walking: 90.0%
- Hand Waving: 88.0%
- Boxing: 87.0%
- Hand Clapping: 83.8%
- Jogging: 73.0%
- Running: 73.0%

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YeosunKyung/SIGNAL.git
cd SIGNAL

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from signal_model import SignalModel

# Initialize model
model = SignalModel()

# Train on KTH dataset
model.train(kth_path='path/to/KTH')

# Evaluate
accuracy = model.evaluate()
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.1%}")
```

### Running the Model
For Google Colab execution, upload `SIGNAL_model.py` and the KTH dataset to your Google Drive, then run the model directly.

## Technical Innovation

### Architecture Highlights
